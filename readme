This project was intended for use in Bruce Gale's lab at the University of Utah. The files in this repository provide possible dimensions of a device that will separate particles of a desired size, such as chromosomes, blood cells, and sperm cells. Particles are approximated to be spheres.

Full project writeup can be viewed in the PDF in this repository.
